There would be fewer problems if resources were more evenly and fairly distributed. A community should thrive or fail together, not have some fail and some thrive. 

The ""any means necessary"" is troubling, because I don't think a equitable society can come from violently overthrowing its predecessor. Further, if we agree ""power"" is a resource, I'm a bit too cynical to believe there is an equitable way of distributing that.",Bachelors degree,Male,"$12,500 - $24,999",Somewhat to the left,Somewhat interested,I would probably consider it,White31,"It seems a little too radical. I'm all for influencing change, but with the entrenched ways that are in existence we need to move in baby steps, not wide sweeps. Doing it all at once will encounter too much blow back.

I would like to start with some basic rights, like legalizing marijuana, protecting abortion rights, increasing aid to the poor, ending police harrassment etc. After those things are accomplished we can work on changing the government in general.
